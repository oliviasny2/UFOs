## Summary

### Drawback

While this format is very useful for quick searches, the data does not update automatically because it is stored locally.

### Recommendations

Although the filter is pretty comprehensive, it could include all of the variables in the data table in case one of the remaining variables is a better representative of the data being searched. Additionally, it could include a larger set of data to provide a larger selection of data to pull from.
